## Integrated Terminal

The integrated terminal in VSCode can be accessed by dragging upwards from the bottom of the screen, or by using the shortcut `Ctrl + ~` on Windows or `âŒƒ + ~` on macOS.

### Terminal Selection

If multiple terminal applications are installed on your system, VSCode allows you to select your preferred one. This can be done by clicking the downward arrow next to the plus icon in the terminal pane.

### Terminal Splitting

VSCode also supports splitting the terminal view, which can be useful when you need to observe the output of multiple commands simultaneously. This can be achieved by selecting the `Split Terminal` option or by clicking the icon that resembles a square split by a line.

### Terminal Closure

To close a terminal instance, simply click the trash can icon. Remember, closing a terminal will also terminate any processes running within it.
