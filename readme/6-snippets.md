## Snippets

Snippets are a way to quickly insert code. A commonly used snippet is the `for` loop snippet. To use it, type `for` and press `Tab`, which will insert a for-loop. The `for` loop snippet will also allow you to tab through the variable name, the condition, and the increment.

Some extensions main purpose are snippets. The extension `ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets` adds a bunch of snippets for React, allowing to easily create components, hooks, and more. For example, typing `tsrfc` and pressing `Tab` will create a blank React functional component in typescript.
