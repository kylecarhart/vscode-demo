## The Sidebar

### Explorer

- Where you can view files.
- You can also view an outline of the current file you are in.
- You can also view the timeline of the file changes.

### File Search

You can search for files, you can also get to this through the keyboard shortcut below.
- You can search by case, whole word, or even regex.
- You can open a "Search Editor" which allows you to see context surrounding a search with syntax highlighting, linking, and intellisense.
- Clicking the down arrow next to the search box will open the replace.
- Clicking the 3 dots, you can further define your search for files you want to include/exclude.
    - Use asterisks as wildcards, and commas to define more than one rule.

### Git

- Has many of the basic git commands if you dont like the terminal, though I highly recommend learning git through the terminal and I could do an entire session just dedicated to git.

### Debug

- Not going to go into too much detail here, but you can create run configurations for your applications to make debugging easier, which allows you to place break points and view variables in the context of a running application. This can and should be a session on its own.

### Extensions

- Further enhance your vscode by downloading extensions built by the community or even Microsoft themselves.
