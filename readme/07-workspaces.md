# Utilizing Workspaces

Workspaces in VSCode provide a convenient way to manage multiple projects within a single window. This feature is particularly useful when working with a collection of related projects, such as the various microservices that make up your tech stack. Workspaces also support unique settings for each workspace, allowing you to customize the editor configuration to suit the needs of each individual project.

To create a workspace, you can simply select the 'Add Folder to Workspace' option from the 'File' menu, and then save the workspace once you've added all the necessary projects. You can switch between workspaces easily using the 'Open Recent' option in the 'File' menu.
