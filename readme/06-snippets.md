# Code Snippets

Code snippets are a handy tool for inserting frequently used code structures quickly.

A popular example is the `for` loop snippet. To utilize it, simply type `for` and hit `Tab`. This action will generate a for-loop, and you can conveniently navigate through the variable name, condition, and increment by using the `Tab` key.

## Code Snippet Extensions

There are extensions whose primary function is to provide snippets. One such extension is `ES7+ React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets`, which offers a plethora of snippets for React, making it effortless to construct components, hooks, and more.

For instance, inputting `tsrfc` and pressing `Tab` will generate a blank React functional component in TypeScript.
