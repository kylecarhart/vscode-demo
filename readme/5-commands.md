## Interacting with VSCode Using Commands

Commands provide a crucial method for engaging with VSCode and your programming projects. You can access the command palette by `Ctrl + Shift + P` on Windows, `âŒ˜ + Shift + P` on Mac, or `F1` on both platforms.

**Useful Commands:**

- `Format Document`
- `Organize Imports`
- `Sort Lines Ascending` and `Sort Lines Descending`
- `Transform to Uppercase` and `Transform to Lowercase`
- `Reload Window`
  - _This one is particularly useful when your VSCode instance is acting up._
