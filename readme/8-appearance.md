## Appearance

## Drag and Drop

You can drag and drop most buttons and tabs around in the editor to customize your appearance!

For example, I like to have Github Copilot chat, and my bookmarks on the right sidebar.

### Secondary Side Bar

You can also have a sidebar on the right side! To open, click the sidebar button in the top right.

### Zen Mode

Zen mode can help you concentrate on your code. To open, go to: `View > Appearance > Zen Mode`, or click the mosaic button in the top right and click `Zen Mode`.
