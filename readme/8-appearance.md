## Customizing the Appearance

### Drag and Drop Customization

VSCode allows you to personalize your workspace by dragging and dropping most buttons and tabs within the editor.

_For example, I prefer to have the GitHub Copilot chat and your bookmarks located on the right sidebar for easy access._

### Utilizing the Secondary Sidebar

VSCode offers a secondary sidebar on the right side of the screen. This can be opened by clicking the sidebar button located in the top right corner.

### Zen Mode for Focused Coding

If you need to focus on your code without any distractions, you can utilize Zen Mode. This feature provides a minimalist interface, hiding all other elements except your code. You can activate Zen Mode by navigating to `View > Appearance > Zen Mode` or by clicking the mosaic button in the top right corner and selecting `Zen Mode`.

In Zen Mode, all sidebars, panels, and other UI elements are hidden, allowing you to focus solely on your code. You can exit Zen Mode by pressing `Esc` twice or by using the same menu path or button used to enter Zen Mode.
