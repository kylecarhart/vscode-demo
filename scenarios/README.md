## Scenarios

Each scenario folder contains a beginning (`*.begin.*`) and ending file (`*.end.*`). 

The object is the following:

1. Analyze the ending file to determine what your final goal should look like.
2. Open the beginning file and, in as few keystrokes as possible, make changes to the file to match the end file.
